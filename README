A simple Minecraft skin server designed for use with OpenMCSkins. This project is not affiliated with OpenMCSkins.
Please do not use this outside of a personal setting, as I have not tested it for vulnerabilities.
Note that OpenMCSkins includes a more well-developed server that you could use instead.

Using:

Place the skin files in the skins/ directory as PNG files and name them with the Minecraft usernames of the players who play on the server.
Please note that some usernames may be incompatible (Special characters in the filename could be disallowed.)
Launch the program like so: 'ruby server.rb <listening address>', substituting 'listening address' with the IP address of the server. You may need root permissions to start the server because it listens on port 80 by default.
Install OpenMCSkins on all your Minecraft clients and configure the mod to point to the server's listening address.
Launch Minecraft and enjoy!
